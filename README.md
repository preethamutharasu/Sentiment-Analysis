# Sentiment-Analysis

## Description
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using Twitter data, utilizing the  BART model explained in https://github.com/modulai/nlp-modeling-case and RoBERTa base model. The goal is to classify the sentiment of tweets into positive, negative categories.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a Twitter dataset specifically collected for sentiment analysis tasks. The dataset consists of a large collection of tweets, labeled with their corresponding sentiment (positive, negative). A smaller version of the dataset is available on the mentioned repository above and the text data is preprocessed in this dataset. This project utilizes this particular dataset with clearned text. However, part of the project also discusses how to preprocess the text data in the original dataset.
